              Panambur Beach is located at a distance of 13 km from Mangalore to
              the south of Mangalore port. Every year it is visited by hordes of
              tourists and locals as it hosts several events like boat racing,
              kite festival and sand sculptures competitions. Despite a massive
              footfall, it is one of the cleanest beaches one can come across in
              the Western coastline of India. The name of the beach has been
              derived from 'Panam' meaning money and 'ur' meaning place. It is
              the first beach in the country which is wholly owned by a private
              enterprise, i.e. the Panambur Beach Tourism Development Project.
              The motive is to educate the masses about the efficiency of
              keeping beaches clean. Owing to its excellent maintenance, the
              Panambur Beach has been awarded the cleanest and best-maintained
              beaches in India. Moreover, the beautiful beach is open to several
              events, promotional programmes, weddings, parties, etc. The
              International Kite Festival is organised every two years at the
              Panambur Beach which is attended by tourists from all across the
              country. Also, a carnival of more local kite festivals is held at
              the beach during the last week of April. The beach is an essential
              landmark to the location of Mangalore Chemicals and Fertilizers
              Factory and Kudremukh Iron Ore Factory.

              Built in 1068 AD, this temple has the typical Hindu architectural
              style on the basic Vijaynagri style. It is situated at the base of
              the Kadri hills, the chief deity being Manjunatha. The temple has
              many caves around it as it is located on hillocks. These caves
              have depictions that go back to prehistoric times. Kadri was once
              the centre of Buddhism. Buddhism declined and the Natha Prantha, a
              new religion, came to being. They were believers of Lord Shiva and
              the devotees were called Jogis. The temple was renovated many
              times and the current structure was done in the 14th century. The
              temple has an interest connection to Lord Parasurama as well. it
              is said that Lord Parashurama was asked to find a new abode called
              Kadrivana for Lord Shiva. Lord Manjunatha with his many wants
              stayed here, and with the help of Vishwakarma, the temple was
              constructed here. Behind the temple on the hill is the Kashi
              Bhageerathi Theerth. It is believed that the water comes from
              River Bhageerathi in Kashi. As a tradition, devotees visit here
              before entering the temple.
