              Surrounded by the majestically-tall eucalyptus trees and dotted
              with green bushes along the shores, the Ooty Lake is an impressive
              spot in Nilgiris district. The Lake, spanning over 65 acres, was
              originally constructed for fishing. It was later transformed into
              a tourist park when the Tamil Nadu Tourism Development Corporation
              took over it in 1973. There are many fun activities that tourists
              can indulge in when they are at the Ooty Lake. Cycles are
              available for rent to ride around the Lake. Boating is another
              attraction. A tranquil ride through the waters is an attractive
              pastime as it lets one take in the entire beauty of the Lake.
              Paddle boat-, motor boat- and rowing boat services are also
              available. The ride offers a view of the serene greenery around
              and also of the distant hills. Boat races and boat pageantry are
              also conducted as part of the summer festival conducted here in
              May. There is also a garden, a mini train and an amusement park
              nearby. The amusement park has fun activities like a haunted
              house, a mirror house and horse riding, and ensures an exciting
              experience for children.It is one of the principal attractions in
              Ooty, offering visitors a delightful experience amidst beautiful
              natural surroundings. The best time to visit Ooty Lake is during
              the summer months from March to June when the weather is
              pleasantly cool and ideal for outdoor activities. The monsoon
              season, from July to September, brings lush greenery but can lead
              to heavy rainfall, which may limit some activities. Winter
              (October to February) is also a lovely time, with cool
              temperatures, making it perfect for those who enjoy a cold
              climate.
